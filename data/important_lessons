Yes, you're absolutely right! Let's break this down clearly:

ðŸ”¹ Why Does the cart Array Reset on Reload?
When you reload the page, all JavaScript variables stored in memory (like cart) get cleared because JavaScript runs in the browserâ€™s RAM, not persistent storage.

Key Differences Between "Data Arrays" and "Interactive Arrays"
Data Arrays (products)

The products array is reinitialized every time the script runs.
Typically, this array is hardcoded in the script or fetched from an external source (e.g., API or database).
Even if you reload the page, the array is still there because it's defined in your script.
Interactive Arrays (cart)

The cart array is created dynamically during user interaction (e.g., clicking "Add to Cart").
It only exists while the script is running in the current session.
When you reload the page, the cart array is reinitialized to an empty array because it's not stored anywhere.
ðŸ›‘ Example:
js
Copy
Edit
let products = [
  { id: 1, name: "Laptop" },
  { id: 2, name: "Phone" }
];

let cart = []; // This is reset on every reload

cart.push({ id: 1, quantity: 1 });
console.log(cart); // [{ id: 1, quantity: 1 }]

// ðŸ›‘ If you reload the page, cart will be empty again
ðŸ”¹ Summary
Static arrays (like products) remain unchanged because they are part of the script.
Interactive arrays (like cart) reset on reload because they exist only in memory.
To persist cart across reloads, you must store it in localStorage, a database, or cookies.
